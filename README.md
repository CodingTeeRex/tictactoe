# TicTacToe using Minimax algorithm

This application utilises the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to enable playing against a computer. The minimax algorithm maximises and minimises the cost of each move depending on the turn of game.

The application is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and styled using [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page).
